title: “Maybe someone's experiment”

📦

It's a package with someone's experiment in it.

Open it, then continue his experimental process, complete the experiment.

Maybe in the process, you can find new experimental ideas and create more possibilities for experiments. I believe you will not be bored, although this is just a Frankenstein remark.😶

It's not bad to have a look though, it won't cost you much time.

You can create an experiment yourself after reading this and send it to the next you.

There is no order, no structure, and you can wander around at will.
