title: “Maybe someone's experiment”
---
📦

It's a package with someone's experiment in it.

Open it, then continue his experimental process, complete the experiment.

Maybe in the process, you can find new experimental ideas and create more possibilities for experiments. I believe you will not be bored, although this is just a Frankenstein remark.😶

It's not bad to have a look though, it won't cost you much time.

You can create an experiment yourself after reading this and send it to the next you.

相信你也已经看到右下角的小猫咪了，我个人认为还算可爱，它作为这个实验品网站的镇门神出现（是镇门神，不过，其实就也是个吉祥物，猫咪不是都被称作主子吗，当然要给它一个霸气点的称呼），关于镇门神的更多信息详见[镇门神](notes/cat.md)

如果你也想在你的网站添加一个，里面有源代码，可以自行使用。

祝你和镇门神愉快。😉
